<h1>PyGLPK Release Notes</h1>

<p>Copyright &copy; 2007, Thomas W. Finley</p>

<h2>PyGLPK 0.2</h2>

<ul>
<li>Added weak reference support to all the PyGLPK objects.
<li>Testing code is now more exhaustive, and with more testing of smaller components rather than exclusively testing PyGLPK's ability to solve full problems.</li>
<li>Fixed freeing some Python objects too early:  When assigning values to the constraint matrix, matrix value reference counts were not incremented correctly when using implicit indexing (i.e., when the index of an entry was inferred from the previous entry) in matrix assignments to both the entire matrix and individual rows/columns.</li>
<li>The integer parameter <code>outfrq</code> was erroneously identified as being a float parameter in code.</li>
</ul>

<h2>PyGLPK 0.1</h2>

<ul>
<li>First release.</li>
</ul>
