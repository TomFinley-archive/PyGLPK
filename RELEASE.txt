                              PyGLPK Release Notes

   Copyright (c) 2007, Thomas W. Finley

PyGLPK 0.2

     * Testing code is now more exhaustive, and with more testing of smaller
       components rather than exclusively testing PyGLPK's ability to solve
       full problems.
     * Fixed freeing some Python objects too early: When assigning values to
       the constraint matrix, matrix value reference counts were not
       incremented correctly when using implicit indexing (i.e., when the
       index of an entry was inferred from the previous entry) in matrix
       assignments to both the entire matrix and individual rows/columns.
     * The integer parameter outfrq was erroneously identified as being a
       float parameter in code.

PyGLPK 0.1

     * First release.
